======================
 Count Facebook Likes
======================

A stupid js script to find the most popular thing you, or any other popular person, has ever said.

Usage
=====

Copy/paste the contents of src/getlikes.js into Firefox's "scratchpad" (shift+F4) and run it.

Yeah, it's not the most user friendly thing I've ever written, but it works, kinda.
